# Data Wrangling with Python

This project is a wrangling exercise using the World Bank Projects data. This dataset contains World Bank projects along with relevent variables such as Country, Status, Borrower, and Date. The data is stored in JSON format with nested objects in certain columns. Additionally, there are many missing data points, which could be filled in using other columns. This was done by converting the relevent features into dictionary format and mapping the values together and filling the missing data in accordingly.
